## Project Summary

Our website is a comprehensive platform for reviewing and discovering restaurants in Illinois. Users can rate and review restaurants they have visited, building their personal dining history. The site features powerful search tools to find restaurants based on cuisine, price, location, number of reviews, and ratings.

What sets our platform apart is its innovative gamification system designed to encourage authentic and detailed reviews. Users earn points for thoughtful contributions, advancing through levels from Novice to Expert. We offer level rewards, streak bonuses, and special challenges to motivate users to explore diverse cuisines and restaurants. This approach not only promotes quality content but also cultivates an engaged community of food enthusiasts.
